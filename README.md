# Revenue Analysis Project in Hospitality Domain

### Project Background

AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category.

As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them with insights from their historical data.

Star schema lets all dimensional table to be around the fact table and the advantage is to be able to retreive data across different tables accurately to sort and filter. 

During the data transformation process, calculated columns were created as well as measures too. The measures can be accessed using the metrics list file.
